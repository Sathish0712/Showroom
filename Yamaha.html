<p> The <b><i><font color="red">Yamaha RX 100</b></i></font> was a two-stroke motorcycle made by Yamaha from <b><i><font color="red">1985</b></i></font> to<b><i><font color="red">1996</b></i></font> with technical collaboration and distributed in India by the Escorts Group.
 At the initial stage, Yamaha Japan was exporting all bikes from Japan to India.
 After <b><i><font color="red">1990</b></font></i>, Escorts started production in India, with some parts being imported from <b><i><font color="red">Japan</b></i></font>.</p>
<p><b><i><font color="blue"></br>History</b></i></font></br> The RX100 designation was originally used in certain markets for the five-speed, short-stroke 97cc Yamaha RS100DX produced from 1977.
 This was an RS100 (itself a 1976 improvement upon the design of the original reed-valved 96cc <b><i><font color="red">RS100</b></i></font> that was introduced to the United Kingdom in September, 1974, and to the USA in November, 1974) with a front disc brake and a tachometer,
 and was replaced in 1983 with the square-stroke, 98cc RX-S (with part numbers coded 31J), a major update on the RS design (with substantial changes particularly to the cylinder, head, and induction, and the points ignition replaced by Yamaha Capacitor Discharge Ignition)
 which was to form the basis of the Escort-distributed variants including the EY-100 Escort Yamaha 100. The Escort variants of the RX-S had heavier gauge steel tubing and other changes specific to the Indian market, including <b><i><font color="red">slotted</b></i></font> screws instead of the original <b><i><font color="red">Phillips</b></i></font>.
 Names of older variants of the RS line were re-used for Escort variants of the RX-S, including RX100 and RX-Z (a designation first used for a version of the first-generation RS100 updated with Capacitor Discharge Ignition) </p>
<p>Following the poor sales of the <b><i><font color="red">Rajdoot 350</b></i></font>, Yamaha needed to make a new product, and the recent success of Suzuki's <b><i><font color="red">AX 100</b></i></font> demonstrated the potential of small-capacity motorbikes in India. </p>
<p>In India in November 1985, Yamaha released the RX 100 (a variant of the RX-S, not the original RX100 or RS100DX) to widespread acclaim.
 The appeal came largely from the high output of its 100 cc (6.1 cu in) engine. With its lightweight body and high power output, the resulting power to weight ratio of the bike made it the best 100 cc bike ever built for mass production,
 and as a result there is still a high demand for it many years after it ceased production</p>
<p>The RX 100 was quickly adopted by racers who recognized its potential for <b><i><font color="red">drag racing</b></i></font>. Various modifications such as <b><i><font color="red">expansion chambers, head porting,</b></i></font> engine tuning, sprocket changes and wheel size changes became fairly common.
 A large number of customization options include larger carburetors, air filters, quicker throttle, disc brakes, an additional 5th gear, race pistons, racing CDI systems, upgraded tires and suspension damping.
 Tuned RX 100's have completed a <b><i><u><font color="red">standing start</b></i></u></font> quarter-mile in about 14 seconds – a respectable figure, considering the much larger BMW-S1000RR 4-Cylinder 1,000 cc (61 cu in) bike can cover one-quarter mile (0.4 km) in 10.2 seconds.
 The bikes were <b><i><font color="red">knock-down kits</b></i></font>, produced in Japan and assembled in <b><i><font color="red">India</b></i></font>. An easy differentiation between the Japanese and Indian market models was that the model produced in Japan had disc brakes, while the Indian market version had drum brakes front and rear. </p>
<p><b><i><br><font color="blue">Successors</b></i></br></font></p>
<p>The Yamaha RX 100 production run lasted from November 1985 to March 1996. The model was followed by the 132 cc RX G. The RX G had an economy-minded engine configuration with the ports tuned to increase fuel-efficiency and decrease exhaust gas.
 This model was the reply to the stricter emissions controls, which were to continue affecting Yamaha's designs. The Japanese manufacturers responded in late 1997 with the Yamaha RX-135 and the RX-Z which had a tachometer and a sportier headlamp and body.
 Both were mechanically the same and the RX-135 received a lukewarm response. The market also saw five-speed versions of the RX-135s and RX-Z. The final variant was a four-speed RX 135 with a small type catalytic converter,
 sporting a fuel gauge and a speedometer with white dials which was sold very briefly in 2003–2005. </p>
