<p>The <b><i>Toyota Innova</b></i> is a series of <b><i><font color="red">multi-purpose vehicles</b></i></font> (MPV) manufactured by the

<p>In September 2004, Toyota debuted the first-generation Innova (designated AN40 series) in Indonesia. It followed the 2003 introduction
 of the <b><i><font color="red">Avanza</b></i></font>—the replacement for low-spec versions of the Kijang. Badged as the Kijang Innova, the first-generation Innova in
 Indonesia was marketed as the fifth-generation Kijang to maintain the lineage with the <b><i><font color="red">fourth-generation model</b></i></font>. It also had a more upmarket positioning
 than the latter. </p>

<p>A second facelift was introduced in 2012 at the <b><i><font color="red">11th Auto Expo</b></i></font> with updated bumper designs, grille, updated headlights and newly designed alloy wheels. Steering-mounted controls for the audio and climate control system became an option</p>
