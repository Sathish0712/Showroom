<p><b><i><font color="blue">History</b></i></font></p>
<p><b><i>Early years</b></i></p>
<p>In 1934, an Austrian engineer Johann (Hans) Trunkenpolz (1909–1962) set up a fitter's and
 car repair shop in <b><i><font color="red">Mattighofen</b></i></font>. In 1937, he started selling <b><i><font color="red">DKW</b></i></font> motorcycles, and <b><i><font color="red">Opel</b></i></font> cars the
 following year. His shop was known as Kraftfahrzeug Trunkenpolz Mattighofen, but the name was unregistered
. During the <b><i><font color="red">Second World War</b></i></font>, his wife took care of the business which was thriving mainly on account of diesel engine repairs</p>
<p><b>KTM 1953–1991</b></p>
<p>In 1953, businessman Ernst Kronreif became a major shareholder of the company, which was renamed and registered
 as Kronreif & Trunkenpolz Mattighofen. In 1954, the R125 Tourist was introduced, followed by the Grand Tourist and
 the <b><i><font color="red">scooter</b></i></font> Mirabell in 1955</p>
<p><b>KTM after 1991</b></p>
<p>In 1991, the company was split into four new entities: KTM Sportmotorcycle GmbH (motorcycles division),
 KTM Fahrrad GmbH (bicycles division), KTM Kühler GmbH (radiators division) and KTM Werkzeugbau GmbH (tooling division).</p>
