<p>This article is about the former British motorcycle manufacturer. For the Indian motorcycle manufacturer, see
<b><i><font color="red">Royal Enfield (India)</b></i></font>.</p>
<p><b>Royal Enfield</b> was a <b><i><font color="red">brand name</b></i></font> under which <b>The Enfield Cycle Company Limited</b> of <b><i><font color="red">Redditch, Worcestershire</b></i></font> sold
 <b><i><font color="red">motorcycles, bicycles, lawnmowers</b></i></font> and <b><i><font color="red">stationary engines</b></i></font> which they had manufactured. Enfield Cycle Company also used
 the brand name "Enfield" without the "Royal".</p>
<p><b><i><font color="blue">History</b></i></font></p>
<p>George Townsend set up a business in 1851 in Redditch making sewing needles. In 1882 his son, also named George,
 started making components for cycle manufacturers including saddles and forks. By 1886 complete bicycles were being
 sold under the names Townsend and Ecossais. This business suffered a financial collapse in 1891</p>
<p><b><i><font color="blue">Enfield</b></i></font></p>
<p>Eadie had won contracts to supply precision parts for firearms to the government's long-established <b><i><font color="red">Royal Small Arms
 Factory</b></i></font> at Enfield, Middlesex, with its offshoot in <b><i><font color="red">Sparkbrook</b></i></font> and had assumed the brand name Royal Enfield. In 1896
 they also incorporated a new subsidiary company, The New Enfield Cycle Company Limited, to handle much of the cycle
 work and in 1897 Enfield making complete cycles as well parts for other assemblers took all the cycle assembly work from Eadie. </p>
