<p>For the parent company version, see <b><i><font color="red">Suzuki Alto</b></i></font>.</p>
<p>The <b><i>Maruti Suzuki Alto</b></i> is a <b><i><font color="red">city car</b></i></font> manufactured and marketed by <b><i><font color="red">Suzuki</b></i></font> through its subsidiary <b><i><font color="red">Maruti Suzuki</b></i></font> primarily for the Indian market since 2000.
 The first-generation model was essentially the Indian version of the <b><i><font color="red">fifth-generation Suzuki Alto kei car</b></i></font> (with larger engine options). 
The second generation was made as a standalone model, which was built on the same platform as the first generation. The third-generation
 model is built on the same underpinnings as the <b><i><font color="red">S-Presso</b></i></font>. </p>
<p><b><i><font color="blue">First generation (RF; 2000)</b></i></font></p>
<p>The first generation was launched to the local Indian market on 27 September 2000 although the Alto nameplate
 had been successfully used to export the <b><i><font color="red">Maruti Suzuki Zen</b></i></font> to Europe from India since around 1994, having captured 
over 40% market share in Belgium and 33% in Netherlands by 1998.
The original Alto 800 carries the RF308 chassis code while
 the three-cylinder K10 is RF310; the four-cylinder export version is RF410.</p>

<p>Maruti Suzuki India launched a new version of the first generation Alto in the Indian auto market in August 2010, the Alto K10.
 The new Maruti Alto K10 is equipped with the company's 1.0-litre,<b><i><font color="red">K-series</b></i></font> DOHC inline-three petrol engine which also powered the
 Celerio and <b><i><font color="red">Wagon R</b></i></font>, mated to a five-speed manual transmission.</p>
<p><b><i><font color="blue">Europe</b></i></font></p>
<p>This model, using the fuel injected 1061 cc <b><i><font color="red">F10D engine</b></i></font>, entered the European market at the <b><i><font color="red">March 2002 Geneva Motor Show</b></i></font>.
 Being built in India by Maruti, it was only available with five doors, unlike earlier Maruti Zen-based Altos in Europe.
 Unlike in India, European model Alto was available with a 3-speed automatic transmission option. The car was discontinued in 2006. </p>
