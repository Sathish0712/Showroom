<p>The <b><i>Suzuki Dzire</b></i> (stylized <b><i>DZire</b></i>, previously knows as the <b><i>Suzuki Swift Sedan</b></i>), known as the <b><i>Suzuki Swift Sedan</b></i> in Colombia and Guatemala,
 is a <b><i><font color="red">subcompact notchback sedan</b></i></font> made by <b><i><font color="red">Suzuki</b></i></font> mainly for the Indian market since 2008. It was developed as a sedan variation of the <b><i><font color="red">Swift</b></i></font> hatchback. </p>
<p><b><i><font color="blue">First generation (2008)</b></i></font></p>
<p>The Swift Dzire was introduced with a 1.3 L petrol engine and a <b><i><font color="red">Fiat</b></i></font>-sourced 1.3 L diesel engine. Due to the <b><i><font color="red">BS IV emission norms</b></i></font> in 2010,
 Maruti replaced the petrol engine with a 1.2 L K-series engine.</p>
<p><b><i><font color="blue">Second generation (2012)</b></i></font></p>
<p>The second generation Swift Dzire was based on the <b><i><font color="red">second generation Swift</b></i></font> hatchback. This update was a very significant one as its length was
 reduced below four meters in order to get the tax benefit offered to sub-4-meter cars. A 1.2 L K-series petrol engine was introduced, and a 1.3 L DDiS turbo-diesel engine.
 A four-speed <b><i><font color="red">automatic transmission</b></i></font> option was only available in the VXi trim.</p>
<p><b><i><font color="blue">Third generation (2017)</b></i></font></p>
<p>Maruti Suzuki launched the third generation Dzire sedan in India on 16 May 2017. The third generation is based on the third generation of the Suzuki Swift.
 However, for the first time ever, it drops the "Swift" nameplate from its name (except in Colombia and Guatemala where it is marketed as Swift Sedan).
 The second-generation Dzire continued to be produced and sold exclusively to fleet operators in India, while being rebadged as the Dzire Tour S. </p>
