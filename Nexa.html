<p>This article is about the subcompact car introduced in 2015. For the model sold between 1995 and 2002 as the Suzuki Baleno, see <b><i><font color="red">Suzuki Cultus Crescent</b></i></font>. For the overview of all models, see <b><i><font color="red">Suzuki Baleno</b></i></font>.</p>
<p>Prior to this, the "<b><i><font color="red">Baleno</b></i></font>" nameplate had been applied to the <b><i><font color="red">Cultus Crescent</b></i></font> in numerous markets and also for sedan version
 of <b><i><font color="red">Aerio</b></i></font> and <b><i><font color="red">SX4</b></i></font> in Indonesia. Unlike the previous generations of Baleno when it was offered as a sedan, wagon, or a 3-door hatchback,
 the model sold since 2015 is exclusively offered as a 5-door hatchback. </p>
<p><b><i><font color="blue">First generation (WB; 2015)</b></i></font></p>
<p>The car was officially unveiled first to the public at the <b><i><font color="red">66th IAA Frankfurt Motor Show</b></i></font> on 15 September 2015.
 It was previewed by the iK-2 concept car that was first shown at the <b><i><font color="red">85th Geneva Motor Show</b></i></font> in March 2015.</p>
<p><b><i><font color="blue">Facelift</b></i></font></p>
<p>The facelifted Baleno was launched first in India on 28 January 2019. Suzuki redesigned the Baleno's exterior with remodeled
 front bumper with new grille design and new 16-inch alloy wheels design with dual-tone colour. The interior also upgraded with
 a dual-tone black-and-blue colour scheme. The interior noise and ride comfort are also improved.</p>
<p><b><i><font color="blue">India</b></i></font></p>
<p>The Baleno was introduced in India on 26 October 2015. Slots above the Swift, the hatchback was built to maximize interior
 space while retaining <b><i><font color="red">Indian GST structure</b></i></font> benefit for vehicles with length dimension under 4 meters and
 powered by either 1200 cc petrol or 1500 cc diesel engine. The Baleno is exclusively sold through Maruti Suzuki's premium <b><i><font color="red">NEXA</b></i></font> outlets across India.
 The car is available in four trim levels - Sigma, Delta, Zeta and Alpha. </p>
